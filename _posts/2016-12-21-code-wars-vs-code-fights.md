## Code Wars

- VIM / Emacs editor modes pretty awesome
- Community driven?
- Various solutions get more visibility and therefore "Best Practices" votes seem to be more relevant on average
- Really slow UI updates sometimes (click to vote "Best Practice" takes a couple seconds, very "eventual" consistency with kata results)

## Code Fights

- More formats
- More curated
- No VIM editor
